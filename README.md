DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automates and integrates the processes between software development and IT teams.
DevOps combines development and operations to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes. A more nimble software development lifecycle results in a competitive advantage for businesses and their customers.
