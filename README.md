<h2> DevOps </h2>
<br>
DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automates and integrates the processes between software development and IT teams.
DevOps combines development and operations to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes. A more nimble software development lifecycle results in a competitive advantage for businesses and their customers.

There are multiple stages in DevOps and each stage can be a tool or technique.

<h3>SCM/VC:</h3>
To deliver a product to customers, after the Business analysis and requirement gathering the actual development will start, and in the development process, we may generate multiple files either code base (Python, Java, .net, Go, Javascript, Node JS, Shell script, Powershell scripting, etc..) or config files in form of yaml, json, services.
To manage the code with different history versions automatically we can use Source code management (SCM) or version controller. Using these SCM/VC tools we can maintain different versions of each file and retrieve any version at any time.

Example: 
You are a developer in a team with a group of contributors working together on different individual tasks, and after some days the client changes the specific requirement. So, you have modified your code as per the new changes. Later the client wants to get back to the requirement due to business needs.
We have modified the code earlier as per the client changes and we don’t have a copy of the old version. As we don’t have the old version of the source file, need to edit the code. In case we have the old version easily get back the requirement without losing extra effort and time.
Using the SCM/VC not only gets back the source code, but we can also maintain different lines of source code to enhance or add extra features, can create the branches.
There are two different types of SCM tools:
1.	Centralized
2.	Distributed
We can learn about each tool and cover more in-depth concepts when we work on SCM/VC.
