In git the default branch or first branch is main, when you want to streamline the deployments its better have branches like stable (release) and unstable (development). Depends on the branching strategies in git and projects there may be hotfix branch and featuer branches.

A branching strategy, therefore, is the strategy that software development teams adopt when writing, merging and deploying code when using a version control system.

It is essentially a set of rules that developers can follow to stipulate how they interact with a shared codebase.
Such a strategy is necessary as it helps keep repositories organized to avoid errors in the application and the dreaded merge hell when multiple developers are working simultaneously and are all adding their changes at the same time. 



Why you need a branching strategy
As mentioned above, having a branching strategy is necessary to avoid conflicts when merging and to allow for the easier integration of changes into the master trunk.

A branching strategy aims to:
 - Enhance productivity by ensuring proper coordination among developers
 - Enable parallel development
 - Help organize a series of planned, structured releases
 - Map a clear path when making changes to software through to production
 - Maintain a bug-free code where developers can quickly fix issues and get these changes back to production without disrupting the development workflow
