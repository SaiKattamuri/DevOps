<h2>Why Linux</h2>

While going further on each tool, first we need to be aware of the Linux/Unix environment, as most of the projects in IT use the Linux environment for their day-to-day activities, and coming to DevOps Linux knowledge plays a key role.

There are a few tools like Ansible and Kubernetes:

Kubernetes can run Windows and Linux containers.
However, you can only run Windows containers on Windows nodes and Linux containers on Linux nodes. And there's a further constraint: the Kubernetes control plane can only run on a Linux node.

Ansible cannot run on a Windows host natively, though it can run under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The Windows Subsystem for Linux is not supported by Ansible and should not be used for production systems.

Some of the DevOps-friendly Linux distributions are

Ubuntu: For good reason, Ubuntu is frequently ranked first when this subject is brought up.
Fedora: For developers who prefer RHEL, Fedora is a good option to be explored.

So, Let's begin to understand the Linux:
